Homework #4 Pandas
The given data set was exported to a data frame that displayed purchase data from a new video game. Python and pandas were used to extract desired aggregates that quantified values necessary for a purchase analysis.
The data set contained 576 different gamers, of which, 484 were male, 81 were female, and 11 gamers chose not to disclose their sex. The game offered 179 different items for purchase and the data set displayed a range of 780 purchases.
Although there were by far more male players in the data set, females made nearly 85% of the in-game purchases. The female total purchase value out-weighed the males by over $1300!
The main age group of this game appears to be in the 20-24 year range, accruing over 44% of the players. The game seems to be least popular in the 40+ age range, accruing a little over only 2% of the players. The 20-24 year age group also spent the most money in the game, giving a linear relationship between the two.
The most popular items in the game were the “Despair, Favor of Due Diligence” and the “Betrayal, Whisper of Grieving Widows”, both of which made the game over $50.
Under further analysis, it can be said the game makes the most money from female players in their early 20s. If the game wanted to increase item purchases it would be wise to direct advertising to this demographic, thus maximizing profits.
